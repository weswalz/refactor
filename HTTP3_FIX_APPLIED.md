# LED MESSENGER iOS 18 HTTP/3 Authentication Fix Applied

## Summary of Changes Applied

### 1. SupabaseManager.swift (‚úÖ FIXED)
- Added custom URLSessionConfiguration that explicitly disables HTTP/3
- Set `assumesHTTP3Capable = false` to force HTTP/2 connections
- Added stability settings for iOS 18:
  - `timeoutIntervalForRequest = 30`
  - `timeoutIntervalForResource = 60`
  - `waitsForConnectivity = true`
  - `allowsConstrainedNetworkAccess = true`
  - `allowsExpensiveNetworkAccess = true`
- Applied same configuration to both regular and admin clients

### 2. AuthViewModel.swift (‚úÖ ENHANCED)
- Added network error detection for NSError codes:
  - -1005 (Network connection lost)
  - -1009 (No internet connection)
  - -1001 (Request timeout)
  - -1004 (Cannot connect to host)
- Implemented automatic retry logic (3 attempts with exponential backoff)
- Added `networkError` auth state for better error visibility
- Enhanced error messages for network issues

### 3. Files Backed Up
- `AuthViewModel.swift.backup` - Original version saved for reference

## Root Cause
iOS 18 enabled HTTP/3 (QUIC protocol) by default in URLSession. Your Supabase backend advertises HTTP/3 support, causing iOS to attempt QUIC connections that fail with characteristic errors:
- `quic_conn_retire_dcid unable to find DCID`
- `quic_conn_change_current_path` failures
- Socket disconnection with `_kCFStreamErrorCodeKey=-4`

## How to Build and Test

1. **Clean Build Folder**
   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData
   ```

2. **In Xcode:**
   - Product ‚Üí Clean Build Folder (‚áß‚åòK)
   - Product ‚Üí Build (‚åòB)

3. **Test Authentication:**
   - Run on iPhone/iPad with iOS 18
   - Monitor console for "Using HTTP/2 (HTTP/3 disabled)" message
   - Verify successful authentication without -1005 errors

## What to Look For

### Success Indicators:
- "üîê Using HTTP/2 (HTTP/3 disabled)" in logs
- "‚úÖ User signed in" message
- No QUIC protocol errors
- No -1005 network connection lost errors

### If Issues Persist:
- Check network connectivity
- Verify Supabase URL is correct
- Ensure anon key hasn't expired
- Check if Supabase project is active

## Rollback Instructions
If needed, restore original AuthViewModel:
```bash
mv /Users/wesleywalz/DEV/LED MESSENGER/LED MESSENGER/Auth/AuthViewModel.swift.backup /Users/wesleywalz/DEV/LED MESSENGER/LED MESSENGER/Auth/AuthViewModel.swift
```

## Version Info
- Supabase Swift SDK: 2.29.3 (from Package.resolved)
- Target iOS: 18+
- HTTP Protocol: Forced HTTP/2 (HTTP/3 disabled)
